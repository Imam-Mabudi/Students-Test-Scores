# Students-Test-Scores
In this notebook, we will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization on the Student Test Scores dataset. The dataset contains information about students' demographic backgrounds and test scores.
The objectives of this notebook are:

To explore the relationships between different variables in the dataset
To identify trends and patterns in the data
To visualize the data using various plotting techniques
To gain insights that can help us build predictive models for student test scores
Let's start by importing the necessary libraries and loading the dataset.
